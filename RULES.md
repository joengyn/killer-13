# Tiến Lên (Vietnamese Card Game "13" / "Killer")

**Tiến Lên** is a popular Vietnamese shedding-style card game for 4 players.
It's also known as **Tiến Lên Miền Nam (Southern Tiến Lên)** or simply **13**, referring to the number of cards dealt to each player.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Be the **first player to get rid of all your cards**.

---

## 🃏 Setup
- **Deck:** Standard 52-card deck, no jokers.
- **Players:** 2–4 players (best with 4).
- **Dealing:** Deal **13 cards** to each player.
- **Order of play:** The player with the **3♠ (Three of Spades)** starts the first round and must play it in their first turn.

---

## 🧩 Card Ranking
Cards rank by **number** first, then by **suit** (lowest → highest):

`3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2`

**Suit order (lowest → highest):**
`♠ (Spades) < ♣ (Clubs) < ♦ (Diamonds) < ♥ (Hearts)`

So the **3♠** is the lowest card, and **2♥** is the highest.

## 💥 Playing the Game

### Turn Order
- Play proceeds **clockwise**.
- On your turn, you can either **beat** the previous play or **pass**.

### Starting a Round
- The player with the **3♠** must start the game and include that card in their first play.
- The first play can be a single, pair, triple, straight, or valid bomb that includes 3♠.

### Beating the Previous Play
You can only beat a play with a **higher combination of the same type**:

| Type | Description | Example | Can be beaten by |
|------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Single** | 1 card | `7♣` | Any higher single |
| **Pair** | 2 cards of same rank | `9♦ 9♠` | Higher pair |
| **Triple** | 3 cards of same rank | `K♦ K♣ K♥` | Higher triple |
| **Straight** | 4+ consecutive ranks (no 2s) | `5-6-7-8` | Higher straight |
| **Four of a Kind (Bomb)** | 4 cards of same rank | `8♠ 8♣ 8♦ 8♥` | Higher 4 of a kind |

When all other players **pass**, the last player to play a valid combo **starts a new round** with any type of play.

## 💣 Bombs (Special)
Certain combinations can **beat 2s**, which are otherwise the strongest singles:

- **Four of a kind** can beat any **single 2** or **pair of 2s**.
- **Three consecutive pairs** (e.g., `3-3 4-4 5-5`) can beat any **single 2**.
- **Four consecutive pairs** can beat a **pair of 2s**.

Bombs can also be used to beat other bombs of the same type but higher rank.

---

## 🏁 Ending the Game
- The first player to play all their cards **wins**.
- The remaining players keep playing to determine 2nd, 3rd, and last place.

Optionally, in some versions:
- Remaining cards in a losing player's hand count as **points** or **penalties**.

---

## 📘 Summary
